Some personal projects: 

* ⛵️ CURRENT PROJECT, summer 2024 📍: TripTracker. Think of it as Strava for sailing. Tech stack: Native Android App in Java, with a .NET/C# backend hosted on Azure, and a React web-frontend. This is my master thesis project for my MAS Software Engineering degree.

* 🍃 Built a [Java Spring Boot chat app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo) as well as a [Java Spring Boot cloud storage](https://github.com/pinefoambath/cloudstorage) application, to get familiar with Spring Boot.
