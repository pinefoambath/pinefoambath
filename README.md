### Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

I live in Zurich ⛰ 🍫, work at [Simplificator](https://www.simplificator.com), TA at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) 🙇‍♀️ and write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@_andrea). I enjoy learning differente programming languages and frameworks. I've worked on projects using React, Javascript, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails (including Stimulus, View Components, MapBox), Gatsby, Java, Android SDK, GraphQL, Tailwind, Netlify and Sanity. 

Some side projects:

* 🛰 Made a [Mars Rover app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/mars-rover-express-app) with Express and Node.js, to track the latest images sent back from Nasa's Mars rovers.

* 🗞 Used Java and the Android Studio SDK to make the [Good News Mix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rollmopsgames.guardianapp2020), an Android app that gives you a break from bad news. Available on the Google Play store.

* 🚀  Made [Space Pong](https://rollmopsgames.itch.io/spacepong), a retro block breaker game, using C# and the Unity game development engine.

* 🍃 Built a [Java Spring Boot chat app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo) as well as a [Java Spring Boot cloud storage](https://github.com/pinefoambath/cloudstorage) application, to learn the Spring Boot framework (in progress). 

* 👩🏽‍💻 Created several full stack Ruby on Rails web apps, such as [Track My Cruise](http://www.trackmycruise.com) a retrospective marine weather API service for sailors, and [Boat BnB](https://airbnb-pinefoambath.herokuapp.com), an AirBnB-style boat rental prototype
