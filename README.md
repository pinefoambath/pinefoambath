### Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

I'm a Software Engineer in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm making web-based software and Android apps, working across front- and backend. I'm using React, Javascript, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, Kafka, Elixir, Phoenix, Gatsby, Java, Android SDK, GraphQL, Tailwind, and headless CSM systems like Netlify and Sanity. Alongside work I'm studying for a [Master in Advanced Studies in Software Engineering](https://www.ost.ch/de/weiterbildung/weiterbildungsangebot/informatik/mas-software-engineering) at FH Ost in Rapperswil, Switzerland. I occasionally [blog here](https://medium.com/@_andrea). I'm bilingual German/English.

When I'm not working or studying there is ~~ sometimes 🙃 ~~ time for personal projects: 

* 🗞 I've made and am hosting the [Good News Mix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rollmopsgames.guardianapp2020), an Android app that gives you a break from bad news. Made with Java in Android SDK, available on the Google Play store.

* 🛰 Made [Mars Rover app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/mars-rover-express-app) with Express and Node.js, to track the latest images sent back from Nasa's Mars rovers.

* 🚀 Made [Space Pong](https://rollmopsgames.itch.io/spacepong), a retro game, using C# and Unity.

* 🍃 Built a [Java Spring Boot chat app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo) as well as a [Java Spring Boot cloud storage](https://github.com/pinefoambath/cloudstorage) application, to get familiar with the Spring Boot framework. 

* ⛵ Made [Track My Cruise](http://www.trackmycruise.com), a Ruby on Rails app providing a retrospective weather information for sailors, and [Boat BnB](https://airbnb-pinefoambath.herokuapp.com), an AirBnB-style boat rental prototype.

* 💼 I develop, host and run [Career Haus](http://www.career.haus). Career Haus helps people make job transitions, and enables educational institutions provide student career development at scale.
