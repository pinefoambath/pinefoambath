### Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

I'm a software developer in Zurich, Switzerland. I work across front- and backend, across the DevOps cycle. I use a range of programming languages and frameworks:

**Programming Languages**: React, Javascript, TypeScript, Java, Ruby, C#; **Frameworks & Tools**: Ruby on Rails, Kafka, Camunda, Android SDK, SpringBoot, GraphQL, Tailwind; **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, ArgoCI/CD; **Human languages**: German, English

When I'm not working or studying there's ~ sometimes 🙃 ~ time for personal projects: 

* 🗞 I've made and am hosting the [Good News Mix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rollmopsgames.guardianapp2020), an Android app that gives you a break from bad news. Made with Java in Android SDK, available free on the Google Play store.

* 🛰 Made [Mars Rover app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/mars-rover-express-app) with Express and Node.js, to track the latest images sent back from Nasa's Mars rovers.

* 🚀 Made [Space Pong](https://rollmopsgames.itch.io/spacepong), a retro game, using C# and Unity.

* 🍃 Built a [Java Spring Boot chat app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo) as well as a [Java Spring Boot cloud storage](https://github.com/pinefoambath/cloudstorage) application, to get familiar with Spring Boot. 

* ⛵ Made [Track My Cruise](https://github.com/pinefoambath/trackmycruise), an app that provides retrospective weather information for sailors, and [Boat BnB](https://airbnb-pinefoambath.herokuapp.com), an AirBnB-style boat rental prototype.

* 👩‍🎓 Developing, hosting and running [Career Haus](http://www.career.haus).
