### Hi, I’m Andrea 🙂

I enjoy learning programming languages and frameworks and have:


* 👩🏽‍💻 Created several full stack Ruby on Rails web apps, such as [Track My Cruise](http://www.trackmycruise.com) a retrospective marine weather API service for sailors, and [Boat BnB](https://airbnb-pinefoambath.herokuapp.com), an AirBnB-style boat rental prototype

* 🚀  Made [Space Pong](https://rollmopsgames.itch.io/spacepong), a retro block breaker game, using C# and the Unity game development engine. 

* 🗞 Used Java and the Android Studio SDK to make the [Good News Mix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rollmopsgames.guardianapp2020), a mobile app that gives you a break from bad news 

* 🍃 Made a [Java Spring Boot webapp prototype](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo), to learn the Spring framework (in progress). 

I live in Zurich, Switzerland ⛰ 🍫 and currently (remote) teach at the Le Wagon Bootcamp 🙇‍♀️
