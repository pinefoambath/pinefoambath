### Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

I live in Zurich ⛰, am a Software Engineer at [Simplificator](https://www.simplificator.com), TA at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) 🙇‍♀️ and write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@_andrea). I'm making web based and Android software, using React, Javascript, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails (including Stimulus, View Components, MapBox), Gatsby, Java, Android SDK, GraphQL, Tailwind, Netlify and Sanity. 

Some personal projects:

* 🗞 Used Java and the Android Studio SDK to make the [Good News Mix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rollmopsgames.guardianapp2020), an Android app that gives you a break from bad news. Available on the Google Play store.

* 🛰 Made a [Mars Rover app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/mars-rover-express-app) with Express and Node.js, to track the latest images sent back from Nasa's Mars rovers.

* 🚀  Made [Space Pong](https://rollmopsgames.itch.io/spacepong), a retro block breaker game, using C# and the Unity game development engine.

* 🍃 Built a [Java Spring Boot chat app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo) as well as a [Java Spring Boot cloud storage](https://github.com/pinefoambath/cloudstorage) application, to learn the Spring Boot framework (in progress). 

* ⛵ Created several full stack Ruby on Rails web apps, such as [Track My Cruise](http://www.trackmycruise.com) a retrospective marine weather API service for sailors, and [Boat BnB](https://airbnb-pinefoambath.herokuapp.com), an AirBnB-style boat rental prototype
