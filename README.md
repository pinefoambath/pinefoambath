### Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

I'm a software developer in Zurich, Switzerland. I work across front- and backend, across the DevOps cycle. In my work I use a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including React, Javascript, TypeScript, Java, Ruby on Rails, Kafka, Camunda, Elixir, Phoenix, Java, Android SDK, GraphQL, Tailwind, and headless CSM, as well as Docker and Kubernetes. I speak German and English.

When I'm not working or studying there's ~ sometimes 🙃 ~ time for personal projects: 

* 🗞 I've made and am hosting the [Good News Mix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rollmopsgames.guardianapp2020), an Android app that gives you a break from bad news. Made with Java in Android SDK, available free on the Google Play store.

* 🛰 Made [Mars Rover app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/mars-rover-express-app) with Express and Node.js, to track the latest images sent back from Nasa's Mars rovers.

* 🚀 Made [Space Pong](https://rollmopsgames.itch.io/spacepong), a retro game, using C# and Unity.

* 🍃 Built a [Java Spring Boot chat app](https://github.com/pinefoambath/demo) as well as a [Java Spring Boot cloud storage](https://github.com/pinefoambath/cloudstorage) application, to get familiar with Spring Boot. 

* ⛵ Made [Track My Cruise](https://github.com/pinefoambath/trackmycruise), an app that provides retrospective weather information for sailors, and [Boat BnB](https://airbnb-pinefoambath.herokuapp.com), an AirBnB-style boat rental prototype.

* 👩‍🎓 Developing, hosting and running [Career Haus](http://www.career.haus).
